    # This creates a build matrix to test against multiple Python versions,
    # ensuring broad compatibility.

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code so the workflow can access it.
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the specified Python version from the matrix.

          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      # Step 3: Cache dependencies to speed up subsequent runs.
      # The cache is invalidated if the Python version or pyproject.toml changes.

        uses: actions/cache@v4

      # Step 5: Run the unit tests with code coverage.
      # Pytest will automatically run all tests that are NOT marked with @pytest.mark.integration.
