The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol designed to allow AI agents, IDEs, and automation tools to consume, query, and analyze structured data through context-aware APIs.

This server wraps Blockscout APIs and exposes blockchain data—balances, tokens, NFTs, contract metadata—via MCP so that AI agents and tools (like Claude, Cursor, or IDEs) can access and analyze it contextually.

**Key Features:**

- Contextual blockchain data access for AI tools
- Multi-chain support via getting Blockscout instance URLs from Chainscout
- **Versioned REST API**: Provides a standard, web-friendly interface to all MCP tools. See [API.md](API.md) for full documentation.
- Custom instructions for MCP host to use the server
- Intelligent context optimization to conserve LLM tokens while preserving data accessibility
- Smart response slicing with configurable page sizes to prevent context overflow
- Opaque cursor pagination using Base64URL-encoded strings instead of complex parameters
- Automatic truncation of large data fields with clear indicators and access guidance
- Standardized ToolResponse model with structured JSON responses and follow-up instructions
- Enhanced observability with MCP progress notifications and periodic updates for long-running operations

## Configuring MCP Clients

### Using the Claude Desktop Extension (.dxt) - Recommended

The easiest way to use the Blockscout MCP server with Claude Desktop is through the official Desktop Extension. This provides a seamless, one-click installation experience.

**Installation:**

1. Download the latest `blockscout-mcp.dxt` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/blockscout/mcp-server/releases).
2. Open Claude Desktop.
3. Double click to open the `.dxt` file to automatically install the extension.
4. Check Settings -> Extensions if you experience any issues. You can also drag and drop .DXT files into the extensions window to view and install.

### Using the Official Blockscout MCP Server

The official cloud-hosted instance at `https://mcp.blockscout.com/mcp` provides a reliable, always-updated service.

**Claude Desktop Setup:**

> _Note: Docker is required for this setup_

1. Open Claude Desktop and click on Settings
2. Navigate to the "Developer" section
3. Click "Edit Config"
4. Open the file `claude_desktop_config.json` and configure the server:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "blockscout": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "--rm",
            "-i",
            "sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy:latest",
            "--transport",
            "streamablehttp",
            "https://mcp.blockscout.com/mcp"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

5. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop
6. When chatting with Claude, you can now enable the Blockscout MCP Server to allow Claude to access blockchain data

**Cursor Setup:**

Use [this deeplink](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=blockscout&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5ibG9ja3Njb3V0LmNvbS9tY3AiLCJ0aW1lb3V0IjoxODAwMDB9) to install the Blockscout MCP server in Cursor.

**Gemini CLI Setup:**

1. Add the following configuration to your `~/.gemini/settings.json` file:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "blockscout": {
          "httpUrl": "https://mcp.blockscout.com/mcp",
          "timeout": 180000
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. For detailed Gemini CLI MCP server configuration instructions, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/tools/mcp-server.md).

## Development & Deployment

### Local Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blockscout/mcp-server.git
cd mcp-server
uv pip install -e . # or `pip install -e .`
```

To customize the leading part of the `User-Agent` header used for RPC requests,
set the `BLOCKSCOUT_MCP_USER_AGENT` environment variable (defaults to
"Blockscout MCP"). The server version is appended automatically.

### Running the Server

The server runs in `stdio` mode by default:

```bash
python -m blockscout_mcp_server
```

**HTTP Mode (MCP only):**

To run the server in HTTP Streamable mode (stateless, JSON responses):

```bash
python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http
```

You can also specify the host and port for the HTTP server:

```bash
python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --http-host 0.0.0.0 --http-port 8080
```

**HTTP Mode with REST API:**

To enable the versioned REST API alongside the MCP endpoint, use the `--rest` flag (which requires `--http`).

```bash
python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --rest
```

With custom host and port:

```bash
python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --rest --http-host 0.0.0.0 --http-port 8080
```

**CLI Options:**

- `--http`: Enables HTTP Streamable mode.
- `--http-host TEXT`: Host to bind the HTTP server to (default: `127.0.0.1`).
- `--http-port INTEGER`: Port for the HTTP server (default: `8000`).
- `--rest`: Enables the REST API (requires `--http`).

### Building Docker Image Locally

Build the Docker image with the official tag:

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server:latest .
```

### Pulling from GitHub Container Registry

Pull the pre-built image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server:latest
```

### Running with Docker

**HTTP Mode (MCP only):**

To run the Docker container in HTTP mode with port mapping:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server:latest python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --http-host 0.0.0.0
```

With custom port:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server:latest python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --http-host 0.0.0.0 --http-port 8080
```

**HTTP Mode with REST API:**

To run with the REST API enabled:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server:latest python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --rest --http-host 0.0.0.0
```

**Note:** When running in HTTP mode with Docker, use `--http-host 0.0.0.0` to bind to all interfaces so the server is accessible from outside the container.

**Stdio Mode:** The default stdio mode is designed for use with MCP hosts/clients (like Claude Desktop, Cursor) and doesn't make sense to run directly with Docker without an MCP client managing the communication.
