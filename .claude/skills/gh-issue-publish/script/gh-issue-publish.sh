#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Publishes a GitHub issue from a markdown file created by
# gh-issue-bug or gh-issue-improvement skills.
#
# Usage: gh-issue-publish.sh <path-to-issue-file>
#
# The script:
#   1. Validates the file exists
#   2. Checks GitHub CLI authentication
#   3. Parses title (first line, strips "# " prefix) and body (line 2+)
#   4. Detects issue type (bug vs improvement) by section headers
#   5. Creates the issue with appropriate label
#
# Output on success:
#   OK <issue-url>
#   LABEL <label>
#
# Output on failure:
#   ERROR <message>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Success
#   1 - Missing or invalid argument
#   2 - File not found
#   3 - GitHub CLI not authenticated
#   4 - Cannot detect issue type
#   5 - Failed to create issue
