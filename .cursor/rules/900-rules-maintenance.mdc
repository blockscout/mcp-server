# Rules Maintenance

**CRITICAL:** When you create, modify, or delete any `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`, you MUST update `.cursor/AGENTS.md` accordingly.

## Required Action:
Update the corresponding guidance in the "Rule Application Guidelines" section of `.cursor/AGENTS.md` to reflect the changes made to the rule file.

Keep rule application descriptions brief (1-2 lines) and focused on clearly specifying when the rule should be applied.

## Reminder: 
**Before finishing any task involving rule files, double-check that AGENTS.md is updated!**
