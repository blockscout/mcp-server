# Rules Maintenance

When you create, modify, or delete any `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`, update `.cursor/AGENTS.md` **only if** the
change affects:

- **Applicability scope**: When or where the rule should be applied (e.g., new file patterns, different development
  phases)
- **Application triggers**: New conditions that would cause an agent to consult this rule

Do **not** update AGENTS.md for:

- Implementation details within the same scope
- Wording refinements that do not change applicability
- Enhanced examples or clarifications of existing guidance

## Required Action

When an update is required, edit the "Rule Application Guidelines" section of `.cursor/AGENTS.md` to reflect the
changes. Keep rule application descriptions brief (1-2 lines) and focused on clearly specifying when the rule should
be applied.
