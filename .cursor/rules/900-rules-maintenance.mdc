# Rules Maintenance

**MANDATORY:** When you create, modify, or delete any `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`, update `.cursor/AGENTS.md` accordingly.

## Categorization by Number:
- `000-099`: Core Rules
- `100-199`: MCP Tool Development  
- `200-299`: Testing & Development
- `900-999`: Meta Rules

Keep descriptions brief (1-2 lines) and focused on the rule's primary purpose.
