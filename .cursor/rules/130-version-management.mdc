# MCP Server Version Management Rule

## When updating the version of the MCP server, ALL of the following files must be updated with the new version:

1. **`pyproject.toml`** - Update the `version` field in the `[project]` section:
   ```toml
   [project]
   name = "blockscout-mcp-server"
   version = "X.Y.Z"  # <-- Update this line
   ```

2. **`blockscout_mcp_server/__init__.py`** - Update the `__version__` variable:
   ```python
   """Blockscout MCP Server package."""

   __version__ = "X.Y.Z"  # <-- Update this line
   ```

3. **`blockscout_mcp_server/constants.py`** - Update the version in the `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS` string:
   ```python
   SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
   Blockscout MCP server version: X.Y.Z  <-- Update this line
   
   If you receive an error "500 Internal Server Error" for any tool, retry calling this tool up to 3 times until successful.
   ...
   ```

## Important Notes:

- **All three files must be updated simultaneously** - never update the version in only one or two files
- **Use the exact same version string** in all three locations (e.g., "1.2.3")
- **Follow semantic versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) when choosing version numbers
- **Update all files in a single operation** to maintain consistency across the codebase
