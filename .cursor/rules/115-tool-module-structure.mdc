# MCP Tool Module Structure

- Each MCP tool function must live in its own module (for example, `address/get_address_info.py`).
- Organize modules into domain subpackages such as `address/`, `block/`, `contract/`, `transaction/`, etc.
- Shared helpers that support multiple tools belong in `_shared.py` or other support modules and must not register MCP tool entry points.
- Do not define multiple MCP tool functions in the same file.
- When adding a new tool, create a new module in the appropriate subpackage and update imports, tests, and documentation to reference the new path.
