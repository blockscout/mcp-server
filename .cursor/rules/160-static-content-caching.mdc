# Static Content Caching

When implementing API routes that serve static files (e.g., `index.html` or `llms.txt`), load these files once during module import or server startup and store their contents in module-level variables. Route handlers should return the cached data instead of reading from disk on each request. Provide fallback error handling if preloading fails so the server responds gracefully.
