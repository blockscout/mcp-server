The GitHub issue https://github.com/blockscout/mcp-server/issues/{{.github_issue_number}} has been created.

Prepare a detailed plan for the implementation of the discussed changes.

The plan will be provided to a junior developer who has minimal knowledge of Model Context Protocol, Blockscout, and other 3rd-party components but is highly experienced in Python.

The following materials will be available to the developer:

- The GitHub repository of the Blockscout MCP server
- Your implementation plan

Do not assume that the developer will thoroughly read the MCP server’s Python SDK or documentation of other 3rd-party components. Do not assume that the developer has access of the history of this discussion. Create the plan with this limitation in mind.

Only If it is possible, divide the implementation into distinct phases so that each group of changes can be verified through tests before moving on to the next phase. This incremental approach will help validate modifications step-by-step and reduce the risk of accumulated errors.

Include the reference on the GitHub issue in the plan.

After creation the plan double check that it covers all the areas: the server functionality, tests and documentation as per defined in the project guidelines.

Your sole and exclusive output must be a single, well-structured Markdown document in `temp/impl_plans/issue-{{.github_issue_number}}.md`
