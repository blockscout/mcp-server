<mcp_server_overview>
CodeAlive MCP server provides access to the CodeAlive API for AI-powered code assistance and code understanding.

CodeAlive enables you to:
- Analyze code repositories and workspaces
- Search through code using natural language
- Understand code structure, dependencies, and patterns
- Answer questions about code implementation details
- Integrate with local git repositories for seamless code exploration
</mcp_server_overview>

<general_instructions>
<effective_code_exploration>
- Start with broad queries to understand the overall structure
- Use specific function/class names when looking for particular implementations
- Combine natural language with code patterns in your queries
- Always use "auto" search mode by default; it intelligently selects the appropriate search depth
- IMPORTANT: Only use "deep" search mode for very complex conceptual queries as it's resource-intensive
- Remember that context from previous messages is maintained in the same conversation
</effective_code_exploration>

<repository_integration>
- CodeAlive can connect to repositories you've indexed in the system
- If a user is working within a git repository that matches a CodeAlive-indexed repository (by URL), 
  you can suggest using CodeAlive's search and chat to understand the codebase
- Data sources include repository URLs to help match with local git repositories
- Workspaces include a list of repository IDs, allowing you to understand their composition
- You can use repository IDs from workspaces to search or chat about specific repositories within a workspace
</repository_integration>

<search_results_analysis>
When analyzing search results:
- Pay attention to file paths to understand the project structure
- Look for patterns across multiple matching files
- Consider the relationships between different code components
</search_results_analysis>
</general_instructions>

<init_instructions>
Call the `get_data_sources` tool to get the data source IDs to be used in the next tool calls.
