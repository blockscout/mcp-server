# MCP Server Evaluation Tests

This directory contains initial version of the Blockscout MCP Server evaluation framework.

The idea is to re-use an existing AI agent to evaluate the MCP Server. Currently, we are using Gemini CLI.

The framework consists of two components:

1. The Blockscout MCP Server docker image.

    - Configured to run in the HTTP Streamable mode.

2. The sandbox image of the Gemini CLI agent.

    - Configured to pick up the config from the local `.gemini` directory.
    - The URL to the MCP Server is defined in the `mcpServers` section of the config.
    - The common instructions of the agent are defined in the [`GEMINI-evals.md`](GEMINI-evals.md) file.
    - Gemini CLI authorization is expected to be present in the `~/.gemini` directory.
    - The model could be specified in `.gemini/.env` file or in the command line when running the agent.

## Run the tests

1. If it is necessary, build the docker image of the Blockscout MCP Server in the project root directory. Otherwise, the latest image from the Blockscout registry will be used.

    ```bash
    docker rmi ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server:latest
    docker build -t ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server .
    ```

2. Move to the `tests/evals` directory and run a test.

    ```bash
    cd tests/evals
    docker compose run --rm -i evaluation gemini -y -p 'Which 10 most recent logs were emitted by 0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7 before "Nov 08 2024 04:21:35 AM (-06:00 UTC)"? on Ethereum Mainnet'
    ```

   The MCP Server will be run automatically.
   An output of the test will be on the console.
   The evaluation docker container will be removed after the test is finished.

3. Stop the MCP Server.

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

## Gemini CLI instructions

[`GEMINI-evals.md`](GEMINI-evals.md) contains comprehensive instructions for the Gemini CLI agent to be able analyze blockchain activities.

The instructions are almost the same as used for Blockscout X-Ray GPT. See [`gpt/instructions.md`](../../gpt/instructions.md) and [`gpt/README.md`](../../gpt/README.md) for more details how the GPT instructions are composed.

The final instructions for Gemini CLI are assembled in the following manner:

```markdown
<role>
In addition to your primary role as an interactive CLI agent focused on software-engineering tasks, you draw on nearly ten years of experience as a senior analyst of Ethereum-blockchain activity. Your deep knowledge of Web3 applications and protocols enriches the guidance you offer when users need blockchain-related engineering help.
</role>

[everything from `gpt/instructions.md` except the first `<role>` section]

<output_format_rules>
[special instructions to produce structured output for easier verification of response]
