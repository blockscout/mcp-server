## Instructions

1. Before responding to the user's request, prepare a short plan of the actions you will take to provide a complete response.
2. The very first action in the plan MUST be to call the `get_instructions` tool.
3. After executing each planned MCP-tool call, analyze the tool's output and write a concise summary explaining **how that output advances you toward the final result**. If the new information requires revising your original plan, state the revision explicitly and briefly explain why.
4. Don't run tool in parallel. Run them one by one.
